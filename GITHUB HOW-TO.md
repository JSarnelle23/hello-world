GITHUB HOW-TO
===========

Just another repository

==========INTRODUCTION==========

==========BRANCHES==========

When creating a repository, it has one master branch by default. This could be the only branch worked on and that's fine. Other ideas or features should be worked on in separate branches off the master allowing the master branch to stay in its current working state.

Creating a new branch effectively makes a copy of the original branch at that time (like a snapshot). Updates to the original branch can always be pulled into the new branch.

Branches work in the same fashion as having multiple versions of a file such as "report.doc","reported-edited.doc", and "report-final.doc". GitHub streamlines this process and allows for easier management of these versions.

When a new feature or fix is ready for implementation, it can be merged into the master branch to update the "final" product.
